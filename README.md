# Game Description
You have crash landed on an alien world. In order to leave the planet, you must gather resources to repair your ship.
In order to gather resources you must go to the orange ore deposits near your base. You can use the ore you gather to
build drills that will automatically collect resources for you and deposit them in a box. You can then use this ore to 
construct furnaces that will smelt the ore in to materials that can repair your ship. Be careful though, as there are
creatures on the planet that will come to attack you once they notice your mining operations!
